    New ideas often start but dont
    Mistakes will happen, so worry
    Learning comes even if
    Failure is just part of it
    Progress isnâ€™t perfect, and doesnt
    Persistence makes things work
    Keep going until it feels right
    Success isnâ€™t instant, but if
    Challenges shape what everything
    Innovation means trials, as did

    Purpose would fade without of
    A world without flaws, no a
    Need for your genius and job
