    New ideas often start but dont
    Mistakes will happen, so worry
    Learning comes even if
    Failure is just part of it
    Progress isn’t perfect, and doesnt
    Persistence makes things work
    Keep going until it feels right
    Success isn’t instant, but if
    Challenges shape what everything
    Innovation means trials, as did
    Without problems, there’d be you
    No room left to improve, would
    Nothing left to fix, so be
    Skills would no longer be out
    Purpose would fade without of
    A world without flaws, no a
    Need for your genius and job
